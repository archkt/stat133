## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data <- read.csv('u2-lyrics.csv')

distinct_album = c('All', unique(data$album))
temp = c(1:length(distinct_album))
temp
```

```{r}
#setNames(as.list(c(1, 2)), c("foo", "bar"))
setNames(as.list(distinct_album), distinct_album)
#list("Choice 1" = 1, "Choice 2" = 2, "Choice 3" = 3)
```
